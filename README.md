# Hangman
Hangman game made using Python. Allows the user to play Hangman by guessing letters to complete the word or phrase.

Created the summer before I began my first year of University, I made this project in order to learn the Python programming language. 
In order to teach myself the language, I decided to make a project to help me practice writing in it, 
the project I decieded on was Hangman.
